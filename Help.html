            <p>User Manual:</p>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to provide the user with information on ski areas in the lower 48 US States.
                The map tab provides a map view containing locational information of ski areas in the US. 
                Each marker on the map represents a ski area, clicking on a marker will display information on that area's name,
                the state it is located in, and the discipline of skiing the area provides (alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, 
                or both). Different disciplined ski areas are marked with different icons. Alpine areas are marked by a down-hill
                skier icon, cross-country skiing is marked by a cross-country skier icon, and areas with both alpine and cross-country 
                skiing are marked by a snowflake icon.
                <br></br> 
                In order to access a state's information, simply click on a blank spot within that state. This will generate a 
                a list of ski areas within that state as well as two graphs. The first graphs will contain information on how 
                many areas the selected state has compared to all other states (the total in the lower 48 states being 684). 
                The second graph will show the breakdown of ski area disciplines within the selected state.
                <br></br>
                A drop down bar containing state names has been provided as an alternative to clicking on a state. By selecting 
                a state in the drop down menu, a list of ski areas located within that state will be produced. Unlike selecting a
                state by clicking on the map, this method will not generate graphs containing information on ski areas within that 
                state. 
                <br></br>
                The layer select in the top right corner of the map allows the user to switch in-between views of layer 
                containing ski area locations and state boundaries. Zoom feature in the top left corner of the map allows users to
                zoom in and out of the map view. 
                <br></br>
                The data tab provides information on data used in the map. This includes links to the feature layers hosted by arcGISonline
                as well as the data sources and a description on how the feature layers were created. The help tab describes what
                is shown in each tab, as well as how to use the features in the map.     
            </p></div>

        <p>Future Improvements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have drop down selection create graphs like the mpa click function.</li>
            <li>Add a zoom to feature and so map view will zoom to a selected state.</li>
        </ul>
